title: Translating Java to Go language
---

# {{ page.title }}

I have written large Java projects in the past, I have used proprietary
tools to turn them into native executable. The Go language provides a nice 
alternative with several important advantages. Now I am looking into some
automated way to convert may Java codes into Go with minimal manual 
conversions. LLVM, antlr and other tools I am looking at. This will be a 
work in progress for near future.
