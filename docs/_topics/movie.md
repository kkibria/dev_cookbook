> We will have bunch of loose topics here, later to be orgnized.

### Notes
initial storyboarding thoughts. I will use pyqt.... all the speed critial operation will be in qt and c++ world, python biunding will be used on top of that.

protoyping will be easy???
other optiuon is build the whole thing in c++, qt
build the app in rust using qt-rust binding.
how do we incorporate,
- gegl ?? 
- brush engine ??
